\section{Instructions}

Brain is our most important organ\cite{Murre-Sturdy95}. It is complicated nervous system which controlls most of activities in our body and play key part in human cognition. This organ could not be replaced and its function could not be artificially taken over, consequentlly any damage or serious patology change could put at risk whole organism\cite{PREIM2014541}. In the same time it is one of the least know organs inter alia because of it complicity (network consist approximately $10^{11}$ neurons and $10^{15}$ connections between of them\cite{Murre-Sturdy95}). Couple of aquisition techniques which help as to explore \textit{in vivo} this wonder of nature, but with such quantity of data it is also very important how we decide visualise it.
\\
Aquisition techniques we could devide focusing on the visualization of point-to-point brain connectivity to following categories\cite{PREIM2014541}:
\begin{itemize}
\item structural - using Diffusion MRI;
\item connectivity matrices - using EEG, MEG, fMRI, Diffusion MRIs
\end{itemize}
Especially interesting are MRI derived techniques like Diffusion MRI nad fMRI. In MRI strong magnetic field is applied over the examined structure. Basicially in these technique we mesure a time which is needed for tisuses to go back to equilibrium state after aplication of an impuls of magnetic field. In the Diffusion MRI we mesure indirectly movment of the water in neurons and we assume that water molecules move more often along the constrainig structures (\textit{anisotropic diffusion}), concluding from that shape of that structures. Most significant diffrenc compering mentioned technique to fMRI is that instead of water we mesure signal BOLD which indicate augmented use of glucose, which is required by active neurons. That information could help us tu identify what is the activation of diffrent parts of the brain.
